<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pacing Lead Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar Pacing Lead</li><li>Bipolar Pacing Lead</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pacing lead markets are segmented into unipolar and bipolar categories based on the configuration of the pacing leads used in cardiac devices. Unipolar pacing leads utilize a single electrode, which can potentially result in larger stimulation areas but may also induce more interference. In contrast, bipolar pacing leads use two closely positioned electrodes, minimizing electrical interference and ensuring more localized stimulation. Both types are essential for the effective treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, catering to different patient needs and device designs.</p></p>
