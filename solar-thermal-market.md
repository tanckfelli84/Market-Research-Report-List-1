<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Thermal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentrated Solar Thermal</li><li>Non-Concentrated Solar Thermal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar thermal market primarily encompasses two types: concentrated solar thermal (CST) and non-concentrated solar thermal (non-CST). CST utilizes mirrors or lenses to focus sunlight onto a small area, generating high temperatures for electricity production or industrial processes, making it suitable for large-scale applications. In contrast, non-CST captures solar energy directly for heating, often seen in residential water heaters and space heating systems. Both play crucial roles in harnessing solar energy, but cater to different energy needs and applications.</p></p>
